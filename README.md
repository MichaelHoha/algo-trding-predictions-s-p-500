## Is it possible to trade using machine learning models on technical analysis parameters?

### Intro
- In this project, we will be using Data from the S&P500 Index from Yahoo Finance as well as Technical Analysis - Indicators such as:
   - CCI
   - MACDH
   - RSI
   - KDJ
   - WR
   - ATR
   - CMF
- We will be using most of the indicators from Pandas_TA Library and only the WR indicator from StockStats Library because we ran into a problem of getting the indicator from Pandas_TA.
